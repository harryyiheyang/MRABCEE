\value{
A list containing simulated GWAS effect sizes for exposures (bX), their standard errors (bXse),
        the GWAS effect size for the outcome (by), its standard error (byse), and the pleiotropy effects (pleiotropy).
}
\description{
This function generates simulated data for Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis,
considering genetic effects, estimation errors, and horizontal pleiotropy.
It allows for different distributions of genetic effects and pleiotropy,
and accommodates both independent and correlated instrumental variables (IVs).
}
\note{
This function requires the `MASS`, `mvtnorm`, `stats`, and `Matrix` packages.
