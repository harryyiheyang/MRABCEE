\title{Cluster Second Data Frame Based on Closest SNP Centers from First Data Frame}
\usage{
clump_cluster(df1, df2)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data.frame representing the output of a plink clump with parameters r2=0.01.
It contains columns for SNP, BP (base pair position), CHR (chromosome), and P (p-value).}

\item{df2}{A data.frame similar to df1, representing a plink output with a less stringent r2 value, typically r2=0.5,
including columns for SNP, BP, CHR, and P.}
}
\value{
A modified version of df2 where each SNP is annotated with a 'cluster' index corresponding to the closest
        SNP center from df1 based on scaled CHR and BP values.
}
\description{
This function performs clustering of SNPs in a second data.frame based on the closest SNP centers defined in a first data.frame.
Both data.frames should include SNP, BP, and CHR columns. This function scales CHR and BP to ensure distinctiveness across chromosomes
and employs Euclidean distance to find the nearest cluster centers from the first data.frame for each SNP in the second data.frame.
}
\details{
The function first standardizes the CHR and BP columns by multiplying CHR by 10000 and dividing BP by 1e6.
         This standardization helps to manage the scale differences between chromosome numbers and base pair positions.
         After standardization, it calculates the Euclidean distances between each SNP in df2 to all SNP centers in df1,
         assigns each SNP in df2 to the nearest center from df1, and adds a new column 'cluster' to df2 to reflect this assignment.
}
\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(SNP=c("rs1", "rs2"), CHR=c(1, 1), BP=c(150000, 250000), P=c(0.001, 0.002))
df2 <- data.frame(SNP=c("rs1", "rs3", "rs2", "rs4"), CHR=c(1,1,1,1), BP=c(150000,160000,250000,260000), P=c(0.001,0.003,0.002, 0.004))
clustered_df2 <- clump_cluster(df1, df2)
